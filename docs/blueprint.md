# **App Name**: Resume Matcher

## Core Features:

- Frontend UI: Create a webpage with text input areas for job descriptions and resumes, along with a 'Match' button and results display area.
- Backend Server: Develop a backend server (Flask or FastAPI) to receive text inputs from the frontend, pass data to the AI logic, and send results back for display.
- Core AI Logic: Implement AI logic using prompts to extract skills/qualifications from job descriptions and resumes, calculate a similarity score, and identify missing skills.
- Suggestion Generation: Generate a paragraph of advice, such as 'Consider adding keywords related to [missing skills] to strengthen your resume.'
- Results Display: Display the similarity score, matched skills, missing skills, and AI-generated advice clearly and attractively on the webpage.

## Style Guidelines:
